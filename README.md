# A RESTful API Service
Building RESTful web service using Python & Flask

## Getting Started

These are instructions for cloning this repository to build and deploy/run a RESTful web service on your local machine. The web service will accept requests and respond to them as appropriate . See Deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This can be run on Windows, Unix or Mac. The RESTful webservice will run in a virtual environment using Python and Flask

```
python 2 or python 3
virtualenv
Flask
```

### Installing

Instructions on how to install the RESTful service on Python Virtualenv using Flask

On the Windows, UNIX/Linux or MAC system running Python
Python 3 comes bundled with the venv module to create virtual environments. If youâ€™re using a modern version of Python, you can continue on to the "Create an environment" section.

If you are using Python 2, the venv module is not available. Instead, install virtualenv.

#### -Install virtualenv

```
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

On Linux, virtualenv is provided by your package manager:

```
# Debian, Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

# CentOS, Fedora
sudo yum install python-virtualenv

# Arch
sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv
```

If you are on Mac OS X or Windows, download get-pip.py, then:

```
sudo python2 Downloads/get-pip.py
sudo python2 -m pip install virtualenv
```

On Windows, as an administrator:

```
\Python27\python.exe Downloads\get-pip.py
\Python27\python.exe -m pip install virtualenv
```
## Create an environment

Create a venv called "fibonacci". You'd preferably run the following commands in your project root dir:

Unix Commands

```
# python3 -m venv fibonacci
# ls
fibonacci
```
On Windows:

```
py -3 -m venv fibonacci
```

And if you needed to install virtualenv because you are on an older version of Python, use the following command instead:
```
virtualenv fibonacci
```
On Windows:

```
\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv.exe fibonacci
```

## Activate the environment
Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:
```
. fibonacci/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```
fibonacci\Scripts\activate
```
Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.

### Install Flask
Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Flask and requests:

```
pip install Flask
pip install requests
```

### Cloning the github repository

Once you have successfully installed Flask within your activated environment backout of the "venv" directory into the "fibonacci" directory.
```
cd fibonacci
git clone https://github.com/pr0xxy/restful.git
```
## Deployment

Now that you have cloned the github repository you are ready to deploy the service to accept requests and respond to them appropriately.

To start deploy the server enter the following command:

```
python3 restful/start_web.py
```

If everything was done correctly your output should look like this:

```
 * Serving Flask app "start_web" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
## Unit and Functional Testing

Your webservice is running and you need to test it.
